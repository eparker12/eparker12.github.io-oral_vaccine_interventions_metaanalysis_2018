Intervention,Study,NotesBuffer,Sack (1997) *,"This study also examined another buffer, CeraVacx (sodium bicarbonate, trisodium citrate, rice syrup) with identical results. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group."Buffer,Ing (1991) *,This study also examined the same buffer at a smaller volume (2ml). We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group.Delayed first dose,Steele (2010) *,Intervention and control arm recruited separately. Exact sample sizes were not reported for immunogenicity data and were therefore estimated by assuming that loss-to-follow-up rates reported in Figure 1 of the trial report were evenly distributed across arms.Extra dose(s),10/14 *,Study included both a 6/10w and 10/14w dose schedule. The 10/14w schedule was selected as the control group to ensure consistency with other studies and to delineate the effect of extra doses from delayed doses (considered in a separate comparison).Extra dose(s),Madhi (2010) *,Immunogenicity data extracted from Madhi et al. (Vaccine 2012) and Cunliffe et al. (Vaccine 2012). Exact sample sizes were not reported for Malawi data; we therefore assumed that the 85 RVV recipients were distributed 1:1 across the 2-dose and 3-dose schedules (n = 42 per arm) and used the reported seroconversion rates (47.2% and 57.1%) to estimate the number of infants who seroconverted.OPV valency,Sutter (2010) *,This study also included an arm comparing bOPV with tOPV. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group.Probiotic,De Vrese (2005) *,"This study also examined another probiotic, Lactobacillus casei CRL431 10^10 cfu, with similar results. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group."RVV separated from OPV,Steele (2010) *,Exact sample sizes were not reported for immunogenicity data and were therefore estimated by assuming that loss-to-follow-up rates reported in Figure 1 of the trial report were evenly distributed across arms.
