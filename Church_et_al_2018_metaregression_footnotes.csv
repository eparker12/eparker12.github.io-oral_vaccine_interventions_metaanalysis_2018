Intervention,Study,Notes
Buffer,Sack (1997) *,"This study also examined another buffer, CeraVacx (sodium bicarbonate, trisodium citrate, rice syrup) with identical results. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group."
Buffer,Ing (1991) **,This study also examined the same buffer at a smaller volume (2ml). We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group.
Delayed first dose,Steele (2010) *,"Intervention and control arm recruited separately. Also, sample size (N) for immunogenicity data not reported therefore estimated by assuming loss-to-follow up reported in Figure 1 evenly distributed across arms."
Extra dose(s),Madhi (2010) *,Immunogenicity data extracted from Madhi et al. (Vaccine 2012) and Cunliffe et al. (Vaccine 2012). Sample size for Malawi data not reported therefore estimated by assuming 1:1 recruitment also applied to the immunogenicity analysis.
Increased vaccine inoculum,Suharyono (1992) *,Intervention and control arm recruited separately.
OPV valency,Sutter (2010) *,This study also included an arm comparing bOPV with tOPV. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group.
Probiotic,De Vrese (2005) *,"This study also examined another probiotic, Lactobacillus casei CRL431 10^10 cfu, with similar results. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group."
RVV separated from OPV,Steele (2010) *,Sample size (N) for immunogenicity data not reported therefore estimated by assuming loss-to-follow up reported in Figure 1 evenly distributed across arms.
RVV separated from OPV,Steele (2010) **,Data in intervention arm derived from pooled group (RV + IPV and Placebo + OPV). Only one infant (from the placebo + OPV group) did not seroconvert to OPV3.
