Intervention,Study,NotesBuffer,Sack (1997) *,"This study also examined another buffer, CeraVacx (sodium bicarbonate, trisodium citrate, rice syrup) with identical results. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group."Buffer,Ing (1991) **,This study also examined the same buffer at a smaller volume (2ml). We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group.Extra doses,Madhi (2010) *,Immunogenicity data extracted from Madhi (2012) and Cunliffe (2012). Sample size for Malawi data not reported therefore estimated using confidence intervals around proportions.OPV valency,Sutter (2010) *,This study also included an arm comparing bOPV with tOPV. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group.Probiotic,De Vrese (2005) *,"This study also examined another probiotic, Lactobacillus casei CRL431 10^10 cfu, with similar results. We excluded these data from the forest plot to avoid replication of the control group."
